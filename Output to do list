Creating a to-do list application in Python is a great way to practice your programming skills! Here’s a simple example to get you started:
Set Up Your Environment:
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official website.
Basic Structure:
Create a new Python file, for example, todo_list.py.

This script allows you to add, remove, and list tasks from your to-do list. You can run it in your terminal or command prompt.
If you’re interested in a more advanced version, you can explore using a graphical user interface (GUI) with libraries like Tkinter12. There are also many tutorials and resources available online to help you build more complex to-do list applications
